    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
        We are FIRST LEGO League Team 2244, Team Name!  
        Lego robotics can be hard, but with time and effort it can be worth it. That's why with our team of 9, we were able to do what a team of 3 or 4 can do in double the time.
            We as a team are dedicated to hard work and celebrating our victories, and then going right back at it. We are a school team, so we get a lot less time, but are able to get stuff to work just as well.

        <p>Our robot is set to preform 5 sets of moves, getting us upwards of about 170 points. It may not be much at state, but since we don't get much time, as we are a school, we work with what we have.
        Here is our robot run map:</p>

        <p>
        Our robot is built using LEGO SPIKE Prime and programmed in
        blocks.  
        It was based off the basic robot, and has the wheels moved to diffrent places for more accurate turning.
